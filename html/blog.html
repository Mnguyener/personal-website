                        <p class="my-3">Hello there. I am currently in the process of reorganizing/reformatting this blog page. 
                            I have been thinking about the blogs from the past year that I recently published, and I felt that some of them didn't fulfill the vibe I wanted.
                            That's why I am going to work on a more positive approach to this 2023 year. While I want to showcase who I am, including some of my vulnerabilities/insecurities, 
                            I don't want my blogs to be overshadowed by negativity. So! I will put my past blogs in an archive. That way, the unassuming eye won't see anything offputting. 
                            At the time of this post, there won't be anything published in the archive yet, so please be patient if you are curious enough to read them :).

                                    Hello again! I want to take a moment to thank my friends who still keep reading my blog
                                    and have long awaited for them each week. I didn't expect to have an audience of more than 
                                    one person, to be honest. So thank you again for taking the time to read them!
                                    <br><br>

                                    Lately, I have been occupied with officer duties, programming for my classes, and most importantly, 
                                    hanging out with friends (aka procrastinating)! For example, last week I <s>was forced</s> tried the SamYang buldak 
                                    Hot Chicken Flavor Ramen at a friend's dorm. I don't have a good spice tolerance so I was truly suffering
                                    the entire time. My eyes were tearing up, my tongue was burning, and my lips were even swelling a bit.
                                    Thankfully, my friend had milk in his fridge and served me a mug (thank you). Pretty much each Thursdays I spend time 
                                    at the dorms trying to do work, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends and it's been a very fun experience.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Another fun event that occurred was CougarCS's Game Night which was a collaboration with 6 other Computer Science orgs. It 
                                    was super duper chill. Music was playing (one of the songs was Earth, Wind & Fire - September because guess what day it was...),
                                    people were talking in large circle groups, and card/board/video games were distributed. There were Poker, Monopoly, Cards of Humanity, 
                                    Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and Street Fighter 6. I didn't expect much from the night, and was initially nervous because we were delayed
                                    on starting the event due to technical difficulties. But after each club's introduction and after everyone got their pizza and drinks, the 
                                    night finally began. It was the most I had talked to people in a while. Flocking from one group or person to another, I caught up with how 
                                    everyone was doing. I had such a blast that time escaped me too quickly. By the time my friends and I finished setting up Monopoly, another 
                                    friend came by to inform us that we only had 15 minutes left of the event. There went the first game I would've played that night lol.
                                    We quickly cleaned up after ourselves and just talked around the table. And at the end, we took pictures - polariod pictures! In fact, I 
                                    have one in my phone case now. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    Looking back on fun club events like these make me appreciate being a part of the club as an officer. I got to make a lot more connections
                                    than I could ever dream of. And I met many incredible, talented, and interesting people. Many of whom I may never get to see again after 
                                    college, but I will still remember them. And it makes me wonder how long these friendships will last. And how busy will people get that 
                                    I'll almost never reunite with?  
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    Regardless, I remember somewhere below these blogs I was hoping for a better and funner semester. And I think my wish got fulfilled! Of course, 
                                    it's too early to say. We're only 1/3 of our way through the semester. Next week, I want to talk more about my friends :3 (I really love y'all so much, sniff sniff), so stay tuned!
                                    <br><br>

                                <h5 class="card-title">Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2!</h5> 
                                <small class="small text-muted">September 15, 2023</small>
                            </div>  
                                <p class="my-2">
                                    On Monday night, I was sitting on a Discord call with a group of friends and one of them randomly pointed out that I had not 
                                    blogged in a while. I was surprised that they remembered and while it had been on my mind for some time, I didn't allocate 
                                    time for it. I guess that changes now.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I asked the friend what I should write about and they said "ermm.. I don't know. Anything." Really helpful!
                                    <br><br>
                                    So I will spontaneously write about how I currently feel. I just finished watching episode 5 of season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen. 
                                    And it's amazing. I was hit with a rush of joy getting to watch an anime I enjoy. I had forgotten how much I loved season 1. 
                                    And most of all, I missed how the anime showcased endearing friendships. I won't dive too much into it because, spoilers. But, 
                                    Jujutsu Kaisen always made me think about my relationships with the people around me. How long will my friendships last with each 
                                    individual? Who do I picture myself with in the classic trios of the anime? Will we turn out so differently that we end up distancing 
                                    ourselves to strangers? It's fun and sad to think about. Not to mention, the music is beautiful.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    My favorite ED was from season 1, where you see the main characters enjoying themselves at a beach recorded from Itadori's view as 
                                    the melancholic piano plays in the song, "Give It Back." It's a very nostalgic piece when you see how happy the characters are before 
                                    sh*t hits the fan.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    But now I think the new ED, "AKARI," is overtaking it. Especially since it centers on the bond between Gojo and Geto. And after watching 
                                    the arc of them as high schoolers, the song resonates even more. It makes me want to cry as I grieve with the characters over their 
                                    dismantled friendship.

                                    <br><br>

                                    Anyway, that's all I have time to write about. Hopefully I can get back into a normal weekly swing of brief blogs.

                                    “If you had never left Seoul, would I have still looked for you? Would we have dated? Broken up? Gotten married? Would we have had kids together?”
                                    <br> <br>
                                    I watched Past Lives with my friends at our local theater on a Tuesday night. It's about three people: a Korean immigrant woman, her childhood sweetheart, and her husband. 
                                    I first heard about this movie when I stumbled across it's trailer on YouTube. It was an A24 film. Indie. So I knew it was going to be good.
                                    The first thing that captivated me was the somber and nostalgic atmosphere of the story. Where the film gently guides you in the slow burn journey of the connection between two people, 
                                    who both ponder about their “what if?” together. What if they had stayed together in Seoul, Korea? What if she never left to America? What if they had stayed in contact when they first 
                                    reunited through Skype? Because a “them” never happened, there's now a million branches of what-ifs. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    <br><br>
                                    The next thing that stood out to me was when Na Young, our story's main woman, explained to her husband about <b>인연 • (inyeon)</b>, which describes the ties between two people over thousands of 
                                    <i>past lives</i>.  This particular word was what had me listening to the trailer on loop for a day. I'm not even exaggerating. I think it's because Buddhism has a similar sentiment about the 
                                    connections between two people. And in Vietnamese, we have <b>định mệnh</b>, which directly translates to <i>fate</i>. But the twist is that we believe that whoever we get married to in our current 
                                    life is because we <i> owed them</i>  in our past life. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our strong, faithful connections to each other is tied by debt we must pay back for previous interactions that overlapped beyond our lifespans.
                                    <br> <br>

                                    Now, I'm not going to go too much into the plot because you can only feel the raw emotions poured out between the main characters when you 
                                    watch the emotional, sentimental film. But I do want to briefly delve into how I resonated with <i>Past Lives</i>. 
                                    <br> <br>

                                    Going back to the idea of định mệnh, I grew up with the belief that there is a reason, one way or another, that you meet each person in your life. 
                                    To me, this idea was kind of cool in the sense that I knew that I would be learning something important from each special and unique encounter. And it 
                                    became even romantic when I applied it to talking to someone I liked. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    A big part of me worries a lot about whether I can grow closer to this person or not.
                                    And how long this friendship could actually last without draining me in anxiety. But when I think about định mệnh again, I realize that I don't really 
                                    have complete control over how long I can stay with someone. As I'm a person who believes in fate, I don't personally think that we can dictate our reality
                                    in such a way where we have the power to sway what has already been destined. And that means I shouldn't worry about fickle matters of how long I can keep in 
                                    touch with a person if I couldn't bend the universe to my will in the first place. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    And yet, I continue to entertain myself about the "what ifs" in my own life. What if I still stayed in my previous relationship? Would it have continued
                                    to stay stagnant? What if I replied when they reached out to me? Would we have become friends again? What if I tried pursuing a new relationship now? 
                                    Would it bite me in the back? Would it end up severing our connection rather than strengthening it? 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    But right now, it's important to remember that I'm happy and content as things are now. And that those "what ifs" should stay intangible. I remember on the drive home from the movies, 
                                    my friend admitted she related to the film. When she asked a friend about how to stop thinking about the alternative choice she could've pursued, they said "Don't think about them as what-ifs. 
                                    Think about them as things that were not supposed to happen." A bit of a pragmatic approach, but it's definitely straight-forward. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    So if things were meant to be, then I think life will forge those paths for us. And if they were not meant to be, then you have to let go. Just like what the ending of <i>Past Lives</i>
                                    told the audience.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Have you ever heard of the MBTI personality test? It's a series of questions that 
                                    are supposed to reveal your "core personality type". Of course, this is just as much pseudoscience as 
                                    analyzing people's astrology signs. But it's fun to see how "compatible" you are with your friends! 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Anyways, the reason 
                                    why I am bringing it up is because my MBTI is INFP, which stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Perspective. Basically 
                                    someone who is very quiet and reserved. While I'd like to say I have a lot of friends, I only keep a handful close to me.
                                    And even then, I have a time limit on how long I can hang out with people. By the 3 hour mark, I pretty much keep my mouth shut because I generally don't 
                                    have much to say and I rather listen to people talk. Talking genuinely tires me out because I tend to overthink what I want to say and end up exerting
                                    too much effort to carry a simple conversation sometimes.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    That's why when people turn their full attention on me unexpectedly, it freaks me out. I get really anxious and feel like an alarm is about to go off if the attention 
                                    doesn't move somewhere else. I just feel like I never really know what to do. Thankfully, I don't deal with it often. 
                                    I'd say I'm pretty good at blending in the background and timing my input correctly when others are talking. 
                                    <br> <br>

                                    BUT I wouldn't say that being introverted is bad. I <i>used to</i> think that way, but I realized people are glad and appreciative of us introverts
                                    when we sit back and listen to them talk. People like us need to exist in this loud, loud world! <i>Yet even so</i>, I find myself in unfortunate dilemmas
                                    where I'm calling a friend, and the conversation falls silent, and I panic because I don't know what else to say. I want the conversation to keep flowing, but it's hard 
                                    for me to find a common point of interest to pick up the talk again. At moments like this, I regret never learning how to be a better conversationist. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Interestingly, whenever I express my inner conflict to people, they usually say that silence is fine and sometimes necessary. But I can't help but worry regardless. 
                                    When I observe my friends, they're all great at carry a fluid conversation (with witty humor too) and are just, <i>so easy</i> to talk to. I honestly wish I could give 
                                    back the same energy to them so that we can all have a super fun time together. But alas, I was not gifted with being a smooth talker. I should try to be more content
                                    with who I am instead.

                                    Hello, hello! I'm currently vibing to the first Spider-Verse movie playing in the background as I wait for the sequel to come out in the theaters (coming soon on June 1st!!!).
                                    <br>
                                    Anyways, as you can guess from the title, this week's blog is going to be a slight turn from the normal optimistic approach. So let's head right into it.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Now, what you're going to read is very typical of anyone, especially Asian, who has/had strict parents. Growing up, I feared criticism in my work the most. From turning in an essay that took me a week to finish, or showing off an artwork to my artsy friends, to sharing a piece of code that I wrote, already aware of how inefficient or messy compared to others. 
                                    Despite being raised with the expectation of earning 100's when I was little, my work had always been far from perfect. Sure, I had straight A's on my report card, 
                                    but my work <i>always</i> needed something to improve. My essays, for example, were given back to me in C's or B's. My friends, on the other hand, were gifted with a natural flow in their writing and often earned A's from just spending an all-nighter on the paper.
                                    And I remember shying away from looking at what I got wrong and what areas needed to be fixed...
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The critiques embarrassed me and made me ashamed of myself.
                                    Even as I grew up, I never got to feel comfortable with my errors, much less hearing a teacher or a friend verbally tell me what I need to change. It just makes me feel like a little kid again, like I need to be sat down while they carefully jump around words to avoid hurting my feelings, though I try to be appreciative of the feedback. 
                                    Going back on the expectation part, I do remember my mom sighing in disappointment every time she saw my papers and assignments marked up in red pen. I faintly remember her telling me I was a not so bright child, or maybe that was my inner thoughts telling me so?
                                    I think those kind of thoughts have stuck to me like glue all the way to now.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Either way, even as my parents became a lot less lenient when I entered high school and college, the lingering feelings of shame continued to follow me. I'd like to say I am a lot better at handling it now (I used to tear up at the tiniest commments).
                                    But even as my peers and I tell myself that mistakes are <i>fine</i> and perfectly <i>okay</i> and that <i>everyone</i> makes mistakes, it's still hard for me to stomach my errors. Which, in turn, leads me to keep making the same mistake because I end up avoiding how to learn from it. 
                                    <br> <br>
                                    That's not to say I see criticism in a pessimistic view. I really do try to accept it as much as I can because I know it's important to my growth as an individual. If I want to do better, then I need 
                                    the tools to do better, and sometimes that comes from listening to what others have to say about my work. Will I ever overcome this fear? I think so. But it will take time as I build the courage to embrace and reflect on my mistakes to learn from them.
                                    <br> <br>

                                    So I have been delaying myself from updating this blog. Not because I didn't know <i>what</i> to write about, but 
                                    because I had so many writing ideas that I needed to find a way to organize them (and I've been super occupied from this past week). Initially, I was going to delve into 
                                    a topic that had a slightly cynical outlook, but I'm in the process of reworking my thoughts to sound more realistic. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    So what is this week's topic about? Well, I decided to end off my 2023 spring semester with a recap of what I learned and experienced.
                                    <ul><li>I learned how to create a web application in Python with the help of a mini-framework, Flask</li></ul>

                                    <ul><ul><li>initially constructing and organizing a DBMS was toughhh</li></ul></ul>

                                    <ul><ul><li>All I know is that I must work super hard and anticipate that I will be learning <i>a lot</i></li></ul></ul>

                                    who encouraged me to attend club meetings and do their projects with him, and all the people I've met and maintained strong connections to, from my first intro computer science class to my other intelligent, fun, and lovely peers in the computer science clubs.
                                    <br><br>

                                    So there's less than 2 weeks of this spring semester. How crazy, exhilirating, and amazing! So quickly at that! It 
                                    feels like the end is quickly speeding up. Andddd... I feel like doing nothing and everything at the same time. 
                                    <br><br>
                                                           
                                    During the semester, so many ideas sprung out at me: <br><br>
                                    "Oh, I should implement this, this, and that!"<br><br>
                                    "Man, I should write about this one time I..." <br><br>
                                    "Omg this is perfect for my blog, I should put this in there!" <br> <br>
                                    (No, I will not list my actual ideas because I'm afraid they won't come to fruition and I'm going to look silly overplanning everything.) <br><br>
                                    But when it comes time to do the things I've been wanting to do,  I feel myself slowing down to a sluggish stop.
                                    I just want to lay down and binge the Last of Us TV and game series. I can just feel my ultra couch potato mode taking over right now...
                                    BUT, I have so many planned commitments to my university's clubs' projects that it's exciting to just think about them. 
                                    <br> <br> 
                                    My goal is to at least get a headstart on all of them so that the following fall semester will be smooth-going. Not to mention, I want to get back on
                                    the web development grind from the small reddit community I joined a few months ago. It's kind of wasteland right now because everyone 
                                    is busy with their own thing, but I'm hoping we can revive it this summer. Oof, and I'll be occupied with planned social events and 
                                    my internship. 
                                    <br> <br> 
                                    I think, part of the reason why I feel scared of personal productivity is because if I start my projects back up again, then I have stay committed to them. It's much different than the impending deadlines of college and the make-or-break grades. 
                                    And sometimes, it's mentally exhausting, especially when there's many things to do. Plus, it's not as easy as saying you're going to do something. Sometimes a feature takes hours or even days to implement, which deters me from trying
                                    harder. One could argue that is the programming experience, but I want things to actual click into place for once.
                                    Which is why I'm going to try to space out my tasks and social outings so that I don't burn myself out! Do I have a solid plan yet? No! But hopefully I'll think 
                                    of something sustainable before May ends.
                                    <br><br>
                                    But before worrying about all of that... I have to pass my finals first. <br><br>
                                    Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy, see y'all next time! <3

                                    Hello, I am late again. Jeez, it's been nearly a month since my last update! Unfortunately, this blog is going to be extremely short due to time constraints. <br>
                                    Before diving in, I want to give a quick shoutout to a friend who made me update my blog today before midnight (I see you taco lover) and of course, 
                                    my friend who encouraged me to do this blog in the first place (hi bestie)! <br><br>
                                    So, the topic I want to briefly talk about today is how crazy it is during finals season. Professors assign stuff like it's <i>nothing</i> to them and the exams are always during the most hectic times.
                                    You start seeing less people attend classes and out and about on campus because they're holed up somewhere else studying for their finals. Like this week I had homework I spent 3 days on, 
                                    a math exam, and then I have two projects due this weekend! <br><br>
                                    I just think it's insane how people can do an x certain amount of work while also balancing extracurriculars and possibly even a part-time job. So shout out to y'all because that's 
                                    an impressive feat and it's something I want to be able to master. <br><br>
                                    Time management is such a critical skill that I feel like I'm only <i>just</i> learning how to even grasp it. For example, I've been wanting to get involved in my university's clubs
                                    for the longest time, but due to stacking homework assignments and projects (not to mention the commute ride home), they take up an extensive percentage of my free time.<br><br>
                                    That's why this semester I have been pushing myself to attend more club meetings while also dedicating special time to my assignments. And so far? It's not that bad to the point
                                    of breaking down. Like yeah, my grades have not been the <i>best it could be</i>, but I think it's fine to sacrifice them to fun extracurriculars!<br><br>
                                    Anyways, I have to go back to the hard-hitting reality that my projects are due in just a few days now. But my goal for next semester is to be even more involved while also
                                    balancing my academic life. So good luck to future me, my readers, and all the people struggling right now because we <i>will</i> push through it!!

                                HEY. It's me again. So, unfortunately, I will not be able to pump out another post before Monday, but I satisfied my weekly quota so it's fine. Who cares if I update it sporadically?
                                I am determined to give some crumbs the few people who read this (and I will be part of the audience when I look back on this). p.s. I think I have become addicted to separating my sentences with break tags.

                                This spring break has been so hectic. I went out every single day of the 
                                week. Ironically, the only days where I could do nothing were the days 
                                leading up to the Monday of the break. And the only reason I don't have 
                                any time to myself is because of the fear of missing out.

                                During the daytimes, I went to friend's houses to play Mario Party, play
                                board games (we spent 3 hours straight playing <i>Here to Slay - Expansion Pack</i> and it wouldn't have finished had we not forced someone to win;
                                we were literally begging them to PLEASE take our hero cards) watch movies,
                                hangout at downtown Houston, and eat at restaurants.
                                <br><br>
                                At nights (especially the ungodly hours), I would get looped into Discord
                                voice chats because of the fun gaming sessions with new friends and
                                silly conversations that could only occur with old friends.
                                <br><br>
                         
                                Any real free time I had was spent working on projects, whether it was personal contributions to a community project or my class projects, and studying. Cue the sobbing emoji.
                          
                                <br><br>
                                But would I change any part of how I did my spring break? Reflecting back on the amount of fun I had every day, I would say, in the grand scheme of things, no.
                                I am genuinely glad and super grateful that I got to spend time with <i>everyone</i>. It's rare enough that I get a day to spend time with people who I've missed because both 
                                of us are busy with the grind or that person is out of town for school. I was actually talking about something similar with my brother today while we were at a family dinner (this is ironically the rarest form of 
                                interaction in my case). He was talking about how the only free time you'll ever have after you graduate is the weekend. You don't get holiday breaks. No long winter breaks, Thanksgiving breaks spring breaks, NO SUMMER, etc.
                                And I thought, <i>Wow. This is kind of depressing ngl.</i> But what's the point in dreading the inevitability of that 9-5 work life? That's why I want to treasure every moment I have with other humans. 
                                <br><br>
                                Friends are, most of the time, your backbone. I think the fear of missing out really hits during a break because
                                everyone looks like they're having fun and obviously, you want to join in on it 
                                too or else you'll miss out on inside jokes, funny moments, and interesting friendships.
                                Over the years, I've realized that I have a particular habit of multitasking
                                online interactions. If I can text several people, join a voice call in one
                                server, and join a Hyperbeam watch together session in another server, I *will*
                                do it just so that I don't miss out on anything.
                                <br><br>
                                Is it always doable? No. Do I usually end up doing it? Ehh, 50/50 (STREAM CUPID). I do make sure to set limits on myself, especially when I have pressuring deadlines. Plus, too much social interaction is 
                                tiring. Anyways, the point is: it's hard to not get FOMO. My current solution is keeping to strict deadlines and muting all media noise. But I still find it hard to stay off Discord haha. Oh, and I still
                                listen to brown noise which helps me avoid jamming out too hard.
                        
                                So, what about you guys? How hard is the FOMO addiction, if any, for y'all?

                                Goodness me, I am late to my own blog! Actually, this spring break has been so hectic as I've been busy with plans (social and academic).
                                I'll talk about them in future posts (hopefully I can crank out two more posts before next Monday). But for now: MUSIC.
                                <br><br>
                                I am the type of person to always always be listening to something. I don't know if it's an ADHD thing (I am not diagnosed), but I HAVE to have either Spotify
                                or YouTube running in the background in order for me to work. I wonder a lot on whether this is common. Because among my friends, I am the very few who enjoys background
                                noise. Like right now, I am listening to soft brown noise on Spotify, and it's been playing the playlist since morning.
                                <br><br>
                                That doesn't mean I go on full focus mode whenever a media app is playing music though. I actually get distracted quite easily. 
                                <br><br>
                                I'll spend 10 minutes scrolling through my YouTube recommendations to find the *right* or *perfect* song to listen to. Or I'll casually 
                                be listening to a playlist and a song I really like comes on, so I take a moment to jam out and end up getting distracted. So do I really need sound to focus, or am I just 
                                scared of boredom? I wish I knew the perfect mixture of a good study playlist back in high school because I don't think I did any productive studying when I was busy dancing to 
                                killer k-pop and early 2000's American pop songs.
                                <br><br>
                                Anyways, I feel like music is such a critical part to living and *existing* in life. Music has the power to make you feel certain emotions according to the genre you're listening to.
                                If you're sad, and you listen to a sad song. Guess what? Your depression is amplified. And if you're feeling great while listening to your favorite upbeat song, you feel like you're on 
                                top of the world! There's not a day that I will not dance to a catchy song in my room and unleash my inner popstar persona. That's why I just find it so hard to believe that 
                                there are people who do not actually enjoy listening... to anything. Like I used to have a friend who refused to listen to music because it didn't "interest" her. 
                                It worked out for her though because she powered through her homework assignments like they were nothing and finished in the top 5%. But still, life without music is like 
                                living without seeing color. You're simply missing out on the vibrancy that music gives, in my opinion.
                                <br><br>
                                Anyways, I am not sure if I have a favorite genre. Sure, I love k-pop, but it has such a wide range of genres within it that not many people outside of k-pop 
                                realize. My all-time artists are IU, Heize, and SEVENTEEN. My newest favs are NewJeans and XG. And those artists vary quite widely from each other, so I'd say my musics tastes
                                are diverse hehe. As for other music around the world, I think Keshi, OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM, Fujii Kaze, and Nujabes remain to be my top favs.
                                <br><br>
                                If I had a comment section, I would ask y'all what you like to listen to. Maybe I'll implement it this summer; count on me to do it!

                                I don't know about you, but I love starting projects, especially when collaborating with others on Github. The only problem is, I 
                                end up taking on too many things I want to do and not have enough time to put enough work in them. For example, I joined a small community of beginner
                                webdevs from Reddit. Some of the projects they have formulating look really fun to do, but that means I may have to spend hours at a time (that I usually 
                                don't have) to submit something workable. Normally, this would discourage me, but I think it's worth investing what little free time I have in making
                                progress for this little group of aspiring webdevs! Plus, it's low commitment, the host is super supportive and communicative, and it made me realize I know 
                                a little bit more about React than last year, which is a plus for me. Speaking of which, this a reminder to only compare your current self to your past self.
                                You should give yourself a pat on the back for learning so much and persevering through the rough past year! At least give yourself that. 
                                <br><br>
                                Anyways, last weekend I got myself hooked for an hour watching and following along to a Nextjs tutorial, which is a rare thing for me! I usually lose 
                                interest in lengthy videos (or lose hope in myself), but I actually understood 90% of the content. I wanted to continue that spree this weekend, but I have 
                                to study for my midterms that are happening next week. Sometimes I have to remind myself of higher priorities instead of chasing smaller goals.
                                So, hopefully the week after (which is spring break woohoo!) will allow me to go crazy on my awaited projects. But, alas, I have to go study now 
                                and conquer those exams. See you next week!

                            <p class="my-2">Heya! Hope all is going well for my readers. Today I want to talk about my time at my university's career fair. The day before, I went to a workshop
                                that prepared you on what to do or say to the recruiters. I went there expecting to be kept to myself. But surprisingly, I made a few new friends! 
                                We were all nervous and jittery for the big day, so we practiced our lines and gave each other advice and emotional support. It was such
                                a nice moment to share with lovely strangers that I am so glad I went. And then I went home and stayed up till 1 a.m. 
                                researching the companies I was interested in and printed out my notes to remind me of what special information they had and what I could tell
                                them regarding my personal experiences. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think everyone, at some point, has felt that career fairs are nerve-wracking. I remember stuttering my way through my first career fair last semester. I was not only unprepared 
                                for what the companies wanted or offered, but also just unsure of myself. I felt that I lacked a lot of experience compared to my peers. My resume was missing substantial substance.
                                Who was I to go up to a recruiter and prove my worth when I had little to show? But at the same time, I think that alone motivated me to put myself out there. I knew that at the very least, I
                                would gain practice from talking and putting myself out there. As I walked through the doors and into the bustling room, I took a deep breath and walked over to a booth and introduced myself.
                                Surprisingly, the recruiters were very genuine and understanding. Since I told them it was my first time being at the fair, they took the lead and guided our conversation. By the end of the first hour, 
                                I felt my anxiety ease and slip away as I approached one recruiter after another. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Learning from that experience made me take the initiative this semester. I actually wasn't as nervous that morning. Instead, I met up with my new friend from last night and encouraged her to speak to her first recruiters.
                                After talking to three recruiters together, I believed she was ready to do it alone. So we ended up going to the companies we were interested in for the next hour and a half. During that time, I found a company
                                I was really interested in and shared my resume with them. I then talked to other recruiters to get more practice with talking. Overall, I think the career fair was a smooth process for me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This time, I feel a little bit more confident about my skills and projects. But I also remind myself that I still have a long way to go and that my desired company probably won't reach out to me this year and that that is perfectly fine. It just means
                                I have an extra year to hone my skills for the big and better things outside of my university :).

                            <p class="my-2">Today was really fun and scary to me at the same time. The context is that I attended a club's meeting at my university for this semester. 
                                For introverts like me, social events are anxiety-inducing, especially when you go by yourself. And when you are already not a part of a clique, it's even harder 
                            to reach out to people. Towards the start of the meeting, I felt myself stressing out like crazy. While I was already acquainted with others at the club, I didn't know if I could will myself
                            to be optimistic about my social prospects. I worried that I would end up sitting by myself without talking to anyone new. Approaching the building's elevators, I thought, <i>I can't waste two hours here being alone.</i>
                            To my relief, I recognized a familiar person in the elevator whom I met previously at another club. At this point, my anxiety was reaching its peak, so I distracted myself
                            with making small talk. We ended up talking some more on our way to the meeting's room. And thankfully, her and her friend sat next to me. 
                            I think what really helped pull us together was that we were both introverts navigating through a sociable environment at the time. We talked a lot about our fears and struggles in
                            the CS world and having to "put ourselves out there." There were many times she psyched herself out from introducing herself to the club's officers. But eventually, with enough push and 
                            eagerness, she did it! And I felt very proud of her. Her determination was what inspired me to reach out as well.
                            By the end of the event, I realized that everyone was quite friendly and approachable if you just came by and stay around. But that came with approaching them first and faking it till you make it. 
                            I found myself feeling more comfortable with the officers and speaking to acquaintances. My anxiety had shaken off and I was more confident in my speaking skills.
                            So if you start feeling shy when you're attending a social gathering, you're definitely not alone! Many people have been or are in your place. Even if the first step is just introducing yourself, that's already
                            quite big!
