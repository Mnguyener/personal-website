                        <p class="my-3">Hello there. I am currently in the process of reorganizing/reformatting this blog page. 
                            I have been thinking about the blogs from the past year that I recently published, and I felt that some of them didn't fulfill the vibe I wanted.
                            That's why I am going to work on a more positive approach to this 2023 year. While I want to showcase who I am, including some of my vulnerabilities/insecurities, 
                            I don't want my blogs to be overshadowed by negativity. So! I will put my past blogs in an archive. That way, the unassuming eye won't see anything offputting. 
                            At the time of this post, there won't be anything published in the archive yet, so please be patient if you are curious enough to read them :).

                                <p class="my-2">Today was really fun and scary to me at the same time. The context is that I attended a club's meeting at my university for this semester. 
                                    For introverts like me, social events are anxiety-inducing, especially when you go by yourself. And when you are already not a part of a clique, it's even harder 
                                to reach out to people. Towards the start of the meeting, I felt myself stressing out like crazy. While I was already acquainted with others at the club, I didn't know if I could will myself
                                to be optimistic about my social prospects. I worried that I would end up sitting by myself without talking to anyone new. Approaching the building's elevators, I thought, <i>I can't waste two hours here being alone.</i>
                                To my relief, I recognized a familiar person in the elevator whom I met previously at another club. At this point, my anxiety was reaching its peak, so I distracted myself
                                with making small talk. We ended up talking some more on our way to the meeting's room. And thankfully, her and her friend sat next to me. 
                                I think what really helped pull us together was that we were both introverts navigating through a sociable environment at the time. We talked a lot about our fears and struggles in
                                the CS world and having to "put ourselves out there." There were many times she psyched herself out from introducing herself to the club's officers. But eventually, with enough push and 
                                eagerness, she did it! And I felt very proud of her. Her determination was what inspired me to reach out as well.
                                By the end of the event, I realized that everyone was quite friendly and approachable if you just came by and stay around. But that came with approaching them first and faking it till you make it. 
                                I found myself feeling more comfortable with the officers and speaking to acquaintances. My anxiety had shaken off and I was more confident in my speaking skills.
                                So if you start feeling shy when you're attending a social gathering, you're definitely not alone! Many people have been or are in your place. Even if the first step is just introducing yourself, that's already
                                quite big!

                                <p class="my-2">Heya! Hope all is going well for my readers. Today I want to talk about my time at my university's career fair. The day before, I went to a workshop
                                    that prepared you on what to do or say to the recruiters. I went there expecting to be kept to myself. But surprisingly, I made a few new friends! 
                                    We were all nervous and jittery for the big day, so we practiced our lines and gave each other advice and emotional support. It was such
                                    a nice moment to share with lovely strangers that I am so glad I went. And then I went home and stayed up till 1 a.m. 
                                    researching the companies I was interested in and printed out my notes to remind me of what special information they had and what I could tell
                                    them regarding my personal experiences. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think everyone, at some point, has felt that career fairs are nerve-wracking. I remember stuttering my way through my first career fair last semester. I was not only unprepared 
                                    for what the companies wanted or offered, but also just unsure of myself. I felt that I lacked a lot of experience compared to my peers. My resume was missing substantial substance.
                                    Who was I to go up to a recruiter and prove my worth when I had little to show? But at the same time, I think that alone motivated me to put myself out there. I knew that at the very least, I
                                    would gain practice from talking and putting myself out there. As I walked through the doors and into the bustling room, I took a deep breath and walked over to a booth and introduced myself.
                                    Surprisingly, the recruiters were very genuine and understanding. Since I told them it was my first time being at the fair, they took the lead and guided our conversation. By the end of the first hour, 
                                    I felt my anxiety ease and slip away as I approached one recruiter after another. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Learning from that experience made me take the initiative this semester. I actually wasn't as nervous that morning. Instead, I met up with my new friend from last night and encouraged her to speak to her first recruiters.
                                    After talking to three recruiters together, I believed she was ready to do it alone. So we ended up going to the companies we were interested in for the next hour and a half. During that time, I found a company
                                    I was really interested in and shared my resume with them. I then talked to other recruiters to get more practice with talking. Overall, I think the career fair was a smooth process for me.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This time, I feel a little bit more confident about my skills and projects. But I also remind myself that I still have a long way to go and that my desired company probably won't reach out to me this year and that that is perfectly fine. It just means
                                    I have an extra year to hone my skills for the big and better things outside of my university :).

                                I don't know about you, but I love starting projects, especially when collaborating with others on Github. The only problem is, I 
                                end up taking on too many things I want to do and not have enough time to put enough work in them. For example, I joined a small community of beginner
                                webdevs from Reddit. Some of the projects they have formulating look really fun to do, but that means I may have to spend hours at a time (that I usually 
                                don't have) to submit something workable. Normally, this would discourage me, but I think it's worth investing what little free time I have in making
                                progress for this little group of aspiring webdevs! Plus, it's low commitment, the host is super supportive and communicative, and it made me realize I know 
                                a little bit more about React than last year, which is a plus for me. Speaking of which, this a reminder to only compare your current self to your past self.
                                You should give yourself a pat on the back for learning so much and persevering through the rough past year! At least give yourself that. 
                                <br><br>
                                Anyways, last weekend I got myself hooked for an hour watching and following along to a Nextjs tutorial, which is a rare thing for me! I usually lose 
                                interest in lengthy videos (or lose hope in myself), but I actually understood 90% of the content. I wanted to continue that spree this weekend, but I have 
                                to study for my midterms that are happening next week. Sometimes I have to remind myself of higher priorities instead of chasing smaller goals.
                                So, hopefully the week after (which is spring break woohoo!) will allow me to go crazy on my awaited projects. But, alas, I have to go study now 
                                and conquer those exams. See you next week!
