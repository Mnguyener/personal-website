    <h3>My First Post</h3>
        <h5><i>2022-10-27</i></h5>
            <p>
                Wow, how exciting. This is my first ever post on this blog! Right now, I am listening to a warm compilation of Disney songs covered by jazzy pianists and other fun instruments. 
                Since this is my first time blogging, I don't have a clue on how I will sort my writing topics. I have a few ideas on what I want to write, but they are usually mundane thoughts that take up space in my head. Anyways, I would like to credit my friend, B, for encouraging me to create my own website! If this continues to be smooth-sailing, I may consider buying an actual domain, so that anyone can come by and chill. I was also inspired by the lovely blogger, tiramisu (whom the same friend sent me the link of their website to), to write on here. As I read through tiramisu's posts, I saw a glimpse of my future where I could easily write and store my coherent and incoherent thoughts. I think it would be a fun, personal hobby.
                Speaking of thoughts, while I was eating my sandwich (of mustard, mayo, lettuce, cheese, ham, and wheat bread), there was a piece of ham that tasted almost other-worldly in the sense that the flavor brought me to a memory of me eating out at a food place. There was nothing specific about that memory, but the taste was reminded me of a feeling I have whenever I go out and about - exploring foodies or to some extent, shopping with friends. It's a feeling that I am outside of home and the comfort of my surroundings I'm familiar with. The feeling is reminiscent of the times that I am eating food that is not homemade. Food that I bought with my own money. Food that I am eating with my friends (I don't think I've ever eaten out alone). 
                It's a brief, fluttery taste of independence in some shape or form to me. Because if no one invites me out, I will stay at home and eat my mom's delicious, homemade (traditional Vietnamese) food. In which I will only ever receive love, comfort, and warmth from it. When you get used to eating at home, eating out feels like a luxury. A dream almost. It indicates that I have enough money to spend on delicious treats, rather than save money by staying inside. Anyway, a point I wanted to make was that I have never become used to that feeling of "luxury" because it's never often that I go out (unless my friends drag or invite me) as I grew up with a fiscal mindset. 
                But now that I am working towards my degree to get a decent job, I have enticed myself more and more to think about the many things I can spend money on. Things that may bring me temporary happiness (something I wasn't sure I could afford for a long time). In fact, money has become a strong motivator for me to work hard. Is that superficial? I have grown to think that it's just a necessary desire in life. To be clear, wealth is not the endgoal here. I am more than happy to live on a comfortable, medium income. There's only so many things you can buy that make you happy. What I think I really cherish is the carefree feeling of hanging out with your buddies without worrying about how much you can spend in a day.
                I want to live, not lavishly, but contently with the people around me. I don't want my fun experiences to be diminished by financial issues. If the future holds a place for me to be financially stable, I think I can live comfortably in my own skin.
