    <h3>Filial Piety</h3>
        <h5><i>2022-11-01</i></h5>
            <p>What is filial piety you may ask? Filial piety, according to my brief Google search, is "the attitude of respect for parents and ancestors in societies influenced by Confucian thought." You may think that this concept/idea is enforced in some degree of any culture of society, not just Asia. However, filial piety is extremely valued in Asian families; the children are always always expected to repay their parents by taking care of them when they are older. Since parents give all their love to their children, feed and clothe them, and provide support/money for their education, it is highly expected that the children give back the same kind of love when their parents grow older and can no longer support themselves.
                I'm talking about this topic today because last night, my mom sat down at the dinner table where I was eating, casually browsing through my phone, when she broke the silence with a jarring question in Vietnamese. "When you first got a job, did you ever give me a present with your hard-earned money?" I stopped chewing then because I suddenly realized where this conversation was going to go, and it was not going to end happily. "...No," I replied. And she sighed. A look of dismay cast over her face before she quickly covered it up with a tired smile, "That's quite bad." I let the grip on my phone go slack as I stayed silent in shame. "You know, I feel like this generation, especially in America, children hardly respect their parents. They don't talk to their mom and dad often, they don't help out with chores, and they only think for themselves. This generation is becoming more selfish. I see it in you and (my brother) too." I nodded my head in agreement, but couldn't say more. It was true. My brother and I have become more occupied with our own lives. I am stressing about school, internships, and personal issues while my brother is dedicating his time to his job, his friends, and his girlfriend. The way we are splitting our time looks like we don't give any thought to our parents. But sometimes I'm not sure how I can do more for them. Besides, I gifted her part of the money that I earned this summer as a waitress - but I guess that is expected.           
                These past few years, I've been working on being a better daughter, friend, and person in general. But sometimes, I think I revert back to my old self when I'm worn out. Maybe I am becoming more selfish in a bad way. Perhaps, I have been neglecting to look after my mom's health when I could've organized time in my schedule to be with her more. And when I think about how fundamentally flawed my character is, I want to stop everything even more.
