    <h3>Time</h3>
        <h5><i>2022-11-07</i></h5>
            <p>Every single day, I wonder how people have the time to learn new things or do their hobbies. For me, I have always felt like I'm running out of time. I spend too much time worrying about how I should go about doing something that I end up exhausting myself which stops me from doing the activity. Like right now, I am worried about how coherent this post will be that it almost prevented me from making one at all.
                I thought I was hardworking and diligent. But each time I try to learn something new, I just get sleepy or unmotivated. What's wrong with me? Why have I become so lazy?     
                This semester I am only taking 4 classes. While I have plenty of time to rest and scroll aimlessly through YouTube or find a decent book to read, I feel listless. I know I have plenty of time to learn new programming skills, but I always feel demotivated because it takes *time* for me to really understand. It feels like I am putting too much effort in something I can't even retain well. I am envious of people who can easily learn and remember new information. That gives them so much time to do other things they can enjoy as hobbies.     
                Sometimes, I consider using a calendar or a planner. But I know my learning style, and it does not fit with such strict consistency. And my emotions are usually in turmoil or in rollercoasters throughout the day, which makes my productivity inconsistent. It really feels like there's nothing I can do as time slips by me. Yet, I really want this to change.
                I really want to know if there's people like me out there. If you also struggle to learn despite trying your best. Right now, I feel alone in my struggles as all my peers and friends seem so bright and intelligent. As I type, I have a friend learning JavaScript while building their own website. It's truly admiring. I have tried to build and design my own websites in the past, but I kept failing because I felt that I didn't have enough time or I was too dumb to connect some parts together to make it work.
